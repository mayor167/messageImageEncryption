# messageImageEncryption
Python is used to implement this



 A line manager seeks to ensure that the message, “The price of bag of rice should be double. Border shut this morning”, and a digital image sent get to his chief operations Officers without anyone knowing the contents, Use Matlab or any other appropriate programming language to implement the most appropriate cryptography technique for encrypting and decrypting
(i) the message. 
(ii) Digital images that accompanied the message

Procedures employed in solving the problem above are as follows;
To implement the provided code snippets in Visual Studio Code (VS Code),  I followed these steps:
Step 1:  I Installed Python (version:3.12.1(64-bit)) and Visual studio (VScode) on my computer system
Step 2: I Opened VS Code: Launched Visual Studio Code on your system.
Step 3: I created two Python files named messageEncryption.py and imageEncryption.py for message and image encryption respectively to implement my codes.
Step4:  I typed my codes on Vscode into the python files 
Step5: I saved the files: Saved the file with a .py extension, for example, messageEncryption.py.
Step 6: I installed PIL library using the shell code pip Install pillow  on the VScode environment. I installed PIL library because of image encryption/decryption 
Step6: I ran my codes by clicking on the Run button on VScode.
Step 7: I verified the output: as shown in the figure below after running my codes
